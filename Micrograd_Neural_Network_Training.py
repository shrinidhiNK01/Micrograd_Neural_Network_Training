# micrograd is a autograd engine(automatic gradient)
# it helps in backpropogation(mathematical core):-algorithm to train neural networks that effeciently evaluate the gradient that minimize loss function(errors) b/w predicted and actual output and increase accuracy of neural networks and adjust weights
# neural networks are just mathematical expressions
# backpropogation:-error propogated backward using chain rule(calculus)
# Micrograd is a scaler valued autograd engine
